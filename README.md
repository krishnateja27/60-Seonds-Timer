# 60-Seonds-Timer
This project is related to design of 60 Seconds Timer using Difference Amplifier,Voltage Regulator and  Monostable Multivibrator.
The Difference Amplifier is used for removing the high frequency noise.
The Voltage Regulator is used for stabilizing the output.
The Monostable multivibrator is used to measure 60 Seconds.
It is implemented using IC 555 Timer and RC circuit.
The values of R = 5401.642kohm,C = 10uF.
